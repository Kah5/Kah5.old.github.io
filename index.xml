      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed interacting with all of the AGU 2021 participants&amp;ndash;both in-person and virtual! I presented a poster on Tuesday on some of my work fusing tree ring and forest inventory data in a Bayesian state-space model framework to forecast tree diameter and diameter increment in ponderosa pine forests in Arizona (accepted in Global Change Biology, keep an eye out for it soon!), and the next steps we are taking to scale these forecasts to tree and plot-level aboveground biomass (+ uncertainty) in the Interior West US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you missed AGU, you can check out my poster here!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conferencing in the time of COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://Kah5.github.io/post/esa2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:35:45 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://Kah5.github.io/post/esa2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just attended the annual meeting for Ecological Society of America (ESA), my first virtual conference! While I am disappointed that I couldn’t see everyone in person and visit Salt Lake City for the first time, virtual ESA 2020 had its benefits. It also had some downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-positives&#34;&gt;The Positives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virtual format allowed me to  interact with and digest the content of talks more easily. I could pause and look at figures &amp;amp; equations in detail, solving the age-old problem of presenters throwing a bunch of math onto a slide and expecting the audience to digest it in ~15 seconds (mea culpa). The ability to watch talks on my own time also meant that I could take the time I needed to jot down some notes, process, and reflect on the cool science I just heard about. I was also able to ask more questions and with more detail than in-person conferences. Also, if a talk wasn’t what I’d expected, I could get up and leave in the middle, which would be quite rude in-person&amp;ndash;I promise I didn’t do this very often!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-negatives&#34;&gt;The Negatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, virtual conferences come with some disadvantages. In particular, I had a lot of trouble accessing the synchronous live Q &amp;amp; A sessions, and I eventually gave up on this. I think that it will be hard to replace the interactions and networking that happens at in-person conferences, but hopefully we can come up with more creative solutions. I was disappointed that many people submitting only slides for the talks, which (to be honest) I haven’t taken the time to look though many of these yet. I understand that there may be some barriers to recording a talk&amp;ndash;listening to my voice on video is one of my least favorite things, and it took a few tries to record&amp;ndash;but the videos are more compelling, give way more information than just your slides, and you will reach a wider audience. Also, though the online format really lends itself to asking and answering questions, I was also disappointed at how few questions were asked on many of the talks I viewed. Perhaps some of these downsides can be improved upon, especially for conferences later this year which have more time switch to a virtual format, invest in hosting platforms, and develop new ways for us to interact in a COVID-19 world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;will-covid-19-change-conferences-for-the-better&#34;&gt;Will Covid-19 change conferences for the better?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortcomings aside, we should all give major thanks to the organizing committee, who turned ESA into a virtual conference on a short time-frame. Transitioning to all-virtual conferences is certainly a change for most of us, but I hope this experience will make future conferences more accessible to all, less fossil-fuel intensive (by reducing travel), and provide a diversity of ways to interact with other scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another upside of virtual conferences is that I now have a recorded research talk to share with the world. If you missed ESA, you can check out my talk here!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog, so here goes nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to use this space to share posts covering a variety of topics ranging from reflections on recent research, teaching experiences, travel reflections, and some (hopefully) useful coding and teaching resources. Here is a bit more on what to expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code--tutorials&#34;&gt;Code &amp;amp; tutorials:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my research, I have spent alot of time coding and learning new analyses, mostly in R/Rstudio. In this process, I have learned alot from forums, blogs, and other resources, and I plan to share some of this content (and hope it is useful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;research&#34;&gt;Research:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to use this space to reflect on my recent research experiences, and highlight new publications. I may also do some reflections on past field work (with alot of pictures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel&#34;&gt;Travel:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had the great privledge and opportunity to travel for both work and fun. The only time pick up my journal is during these trips, mostly so I can remember what I did, what I saw, on which trails I traveled, and where I camped. I plan to share some of these reflections here as well. Since travel has been put on hold for awhile (writing this in May 2020), I may dig up some of these old trips to share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Forecasting Forest Responses</title>
      <link>https://Kah5.github.io/project/internal-project/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forest response to climate changes are critical to future carbon uptake and resilience, but remain highly uncertain. Although higher temperatures and drier conditions may result in decreased carbon uptake, it may be possible to manage for stand conditions that are resilient to climate extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve forecasts, I assimilate two large datasets in a state space modelling framework: repeat censuses from the Forest Inventory &amp;amp; Analysis and annual tree ring growth records. This approach leverages the extensive spatial network and decadal timescale of forest surveys, and the rich temporal responses to interannual climate contained in tree ring records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in hearing more? Check out the videos related to this work below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out an outreach video we made for display at the Laboratory of Tree Ring Research:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CO2 fertilization and tree growth</title>
      <link>https://Kah5.github.io/project/project3/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://Kah5.github.io/project/project3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do concurrent changes in CO2, precipitation, and temperature jointly affect tree ring growth at a temperate savanna-forest boundary? Specifically, does rising CO2 and water use efficiency enhance tree growth by reducing drought sensitivity, or do increased temperatures drive growth declines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I developed Bayesian models of tree growth and water use efficiency to predict the joint response to three concurrent drivers of global environmental change: precipitation, temperature, and CO2. I also quantified how biological differences in stand structure (open canopy or closed canopy) can mediate growth and physiological responses to environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple Stable States</title>
      <link>https://Kah5.github.io/project/old/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://Kah5.github.io/project/old/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human activity has the potential to collapse vegetation at the biome scale from one stable state to another, but well-documented instances of changes in biome stability are scarce. Demonstrating such a collapse requires evidence that vegetation had alternative states before an intensification of human activity, and that it subsequently stabilized to a single state. We reconstructed a biome-scale state shift across the U.S. upper Midwest based on historical (mid-1800’s) and contemporary (1999 - 2016) vegetation survey data. Before extensive fire suppression, logging, and land use conversion, vegetation structure and composition were bimodal with respect to the environment, but now consist of a single stable forested state that would have been unstable in the historical period. This collapse of historical vegetation carries cautionary parallels to modern multiple-stable-state systems facing anthropogenic changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Species Interactions and Environmental gradients</title>
      <link>https://Kah5.github.io/project/gjam/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://Kah5.github.io/project/gjam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What factors determine how tree species are distributed across a landscape? Are interactions and feedbacks between species, or species responses to the environment more important constraints on aboveground biomass? Are these feedbacks and environmental responses constant over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both environmental gradients and interactions between tree species can influence the geographic distribution of different species and the total biomass stored on the landscape. Thus, our ability to forecast responses to climatic changes depends on both species responses to environmental limits, and the competitive or facilitative interactions between species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a Generalized Joint Attribute Modelling (GJAM) approach to quantify past (1800’s) and modern (2000’s) species responses to environmental gradients in the US Midwest, and identify strong interactions between species that are not due to common environmental sensitivities. I show that while environmental responses are relatively conserved over time, historical land use change and loss of late successional forests removed strong species interactions that historically led to high biomass forests.&lt;/p&gt;
