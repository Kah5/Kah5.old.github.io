Dr. Margaret Evans and I had chance to catch up with Mark Albert, at Hearst media, to talk about our work "Forecasting Our Future". John Shaw (USDA Forest Service) is also featured in this piece, and he had a chance to bring Mark and the film crew out into the field! This piece was featured as a part of the primetime Earth day special nationwide at Hearst affiliate stations.
