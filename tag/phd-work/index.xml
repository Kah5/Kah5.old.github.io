      <title>CO2 fertilization and tree growth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do concurrent changes in CO2, precipitation, and temperature jointly affect tree ring growth at a temperate savanna-forest boundary? Specifically, does rising CO2 and water use efficiency enhance tree growth by reducing drought sensitivity, or do increased temperatures drive growth declines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I developed Bayesian models of tree growth and water use efficiency to predict the joint response to three concurrent drivers of global environmental change: precipitation, temperature, and CO2. I also quantified how biological differences in stand structure (open canopy or closed canopy) can mediate growth and physiological responses to environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple Stable States</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human activity has the potential to collapse vegetation at the biome scale from one stable state to another, but well-documented instances of changes in biome stability are scarce. Demonstrating such a collapse requires evidence that vegetation had alternative states before an intensification of human activity, and that it subsequently stabilized to a single state. We reconstructed a biome-scale state shift across the U.S. upper Midwest based on historical (mid-1800’s) and contemporary (1999 - 2016) vegetation survey data. Before extensive fire suppression, logging, and land use conversion, vegetation structure and composition were bimodal with respect to the environment, but now consist of a single stable forested state that would have been unstable in the historical period. This collapse of historical vegetation carries cautionary parallels to modern multiple-stable-state systems facing anthropogenic changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Species Interactions and Environmental gradients</title>
      <link>https://Kah5.github.io/project/gjam/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What factors determine how tree species are distributed across a landscape? Are interactions and feedbacks between species, or species responses to the environment more important constraints on aboveground biomass? Are these feedbacks and environmental responses constant over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both environmental gradients and interactions between tree species can influence the geographic distribution of different species and the total biomass stored on the landscape. Thus, our ability to forecast responses to climatic changes depends on both species responses to environmental limits, and the competitive or facilitative interactions between species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a Generalized Joint Attribute Modelling (GJAM) approach to quantify past (1800’s) and modern (2000’s) species responses to environmental gradients in the US Midwest, and identify strong interactions between species that are not due to common environmental sensitivities. I show that while environmental responses are relatively conserved over time, historical land use change and loss of late successional forests removed strong species interactions that historically led to high biomass forests.&lt;/p&gt;
